### Why Does This Exist?

Great question! You see, once upon a time, someone realized that paying $5/month for a "link-tree" service was about as sensible as buying bottled water from the Arctic. Thus, this project was born from the ashes of fiscal responsibility and sprinkled with the glitter of rebellion against subscription-based link aggregation tyranny.

### The Deep, Philosophical Purpose

This repository exists to solve humanity's greatest challenge: **How do we elegantly tell people we're too lazy to build a real website right now?**

The answer? A glitching, cyberpunk-aesthetic "Coming Soon" page that screams "I'm technologically competent, I just haven't gotten around to it yet!" while simultaneously deterring anyone from actually expecting content anytime soon.

### Why NOT Use Free Link-Tree Alternatives?

Because where's the fun in that? Why use a perfectly functional service when you can:

1. **Spend 47 hours** configuring deployment pipelines
2. **Write custom CSS animations** that serve absolutely no functional purpose
3. **Debug why your glitch effect looks weird on Safari** (spoiler: it's always Safari)
4. **Feel superior** knowing your coming soon page has MORE CODE than most people's actual websites
5. **Maintain your own infrastructure** for what could literally be a text file

### The Technical Masterpiece

This project features:

- 🎨 **A Black Background** - Revolutionary, we know. We considered other colors, but black is:
  - 50% more mysterious
  - 100% more cyberpunk
  - Saves approximately 0.0001% of your monitor's energy
  
- ⚡ **Glitching Text Animation** - Because static text is for people who don't appreciate:
  - CSS keyframe animations that would make a film editor weep
  - JavaScript that randomly shakes your text like it's having an existential crisis
  - The aesthetic of a 1990s hacker movie, but modernized for 2026's discerning taste

- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Works on phones, tablets, and probably your smart fridge
  
- 🚀 **Vercel Deployment Ready** - Because we're fancy like that

### How to Deploy Your Own Monument to Procrastination

1. Fork this repo
2. Connect it to Vercel (it's free, unlike those link-tree services)
3. Watch as Vercel's robots do all the work
4. Bask in the glory of your placeholder page
5. Promise yourself you'll add real content "next week"
6. Repeat step 5 indefinitely

### The Roadmap (aka: Things That Will Never Happen)

- [ ] Actually add links (who needs 'em?)
- [ ] Create a real portfolio (tomorrow, definitely tomorrow)
- [ ] Add more glitch effects (can never have too many)
- [ ] Integrate with the blockchain somehow (it's 2026, everything needs blockchain)
- [ ] Make the text say something else (but what could be more honest than "Coming Soon"?)

### Contributing

Feel free to submit PRs that make this even more unnecessarily complex! Bonus points if you:
- Add THREE.js for no reason
- Implement a particle system
- Create a custom font that's harder to read
- Add sound effects (who doesn't want their coming soon page to make noise?)

### License

MIT - Because even our procrastination is open source.

### Final Thoughts

Remember: This project exists because someone, somewhere, decided that paying for a link aggregation service was too mainstream. Now we have a glitching "Coming Soon" page that costs exactly $0/month (not counting the countless hours spent on it).

Was it worth it? Absolutely not. Will we do it again? Absolutely yes.

**Live the dream. Deploy the placeholder. Never finish the website.**

*P.S. - If you're actually reading this, congratulations! You've found the most over-documented "Coming Soon" page on GitHub. We should be friends.*
